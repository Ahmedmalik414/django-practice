# Day 02 — URLs, Views & Templates

## Goals
- Connect URLs to views cleanly
- Render dynamic data in templates
- Use base templates and static assets

## What I Practiced
- Built multiple pages (Home, About, Contact)
- Passed data from views to templates
- Used template inheritance for layout reuse

## Key Concepts
- URL routing patterns
- Function-based views
- Template inheritance + blocks

## Commands Used
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Notes
- Use a shared base template for consistent layout
- Keep templates organized per app
